            <h3>Information for authors</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>Submissions</h4>
            <p>Authors will submit papers via the HotCRP conference review software (link to be provided soon). 
                Please use the standard fonts/formatting in the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM conference proceedings template</a> 
                . Submissions should be a maximum of ten
                (10) pages of single-spaced two-column text, not including references, with a minimum 10pt font. 
                </p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h4>Anonymity</h4>
            <p>
                Submissions (both abstract and paper) should be prepared for double-blind review, i.e., 
                without author names or other identifying material. The submission system requests 
                information about the authors. This information will not be given to the reviewers. 
                Authors should refer to themselves in the third person when citing their own work. 
                Authors should under no circumstances reveal their identity or affiliation through any 
                side channels, including but not limited to the metadata of the submitted PDF files, 
                their prior work, or acronyms of systems which have already been released to the public. 
                If authors have any doubts on whether any aspect of their submission violates anonymity
                they should contact the Program Chairs. Authors may contact only the Program Chairs for
                any matters regarding submitted papers during and after the review process. Contacting 
                PC or ERC members about submitted paper(s) is an ethical violation and grounds for 
                immediate rejection of the paper.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h4>Concurrent Submissions</h4>
            <p>
               The authors guarantee that by submitting a paper to ICS the paper has not been previously 
                published or accepted for publication in the same or substantially similar form in any 
                conference, workshop or journal. Exceptions are only venues without archival proceedings 
                or venues that explicitly state that they don’t preclude conference submissions of the 
                same material. Technical reports and papers posted on public web sites, social media, 
                or online repositories such as Arxiv.org are not considered prior publications. However, 
                authors must refrain from citing or referring to such posted work in any way during the
                ICS’22 review period to preserve anonymity. The authors should also ensure that the paper 
                does not have substantial overlap with paper(s) submitted concurrently to other venues 
                during the ICS’22 review period. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to 
                immediate rejection.  As always, if you are in doubt, it is best to contact the program 
                chairs.  Finally, we also note that the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy">ACM Plagiarism Policy</a> 
                 covers a range of ethical 
                issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or one’s own work.
            </p>

            <h4>Ethical Obligations</h4>

             <ul>
  <li>Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members to encourage or solicit them to bid on any paper.</li>
  <li>Authors are not allowed to attempt to sway a reviewer to review any paper positively or negatively.</li>
  <li>Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members requesting any type of information about the reviewing process, either in general or specifically about submitted papers.</li>             
 <li>Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members to ask about the outcomes of any papers.</li>
  <li>Authors must also abide by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">ACM ethics policy</a>. Violation of the ACM ethics policy may result in rejection of the submission and possible action by the ACM.</li>          
   <li>Authors are not allowed to advertise their submissions or related technical reports and postings 
       (e.g., to arxiv.org or online repositories) on social media or community blogs and webpages
       during the period starting two weeks before the submission deadline and ending when the ICS’22 
       acceptance results are public.</li>
           
    <li>ICS’22 follows the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/roles-and-responsibilities">ACM Author Representations Policy</a>.</li>
            </ul> 
            
            <br>
            
            
       <h4>Upon Acceptance of Your Paper</h4>
            <p>
              Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection on the Decision Notification Date. 
                At this point, contact authors of accepted papers will receive instructions on how to
                prepare and submit a final version by the Camera-Ready Deadline.
            <br>
                <br>
                <b>AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:</b> The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made 
                available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first 
                day of the conference. The official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent 
                filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are
                published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official 
                publication date remains the first day of the conference.)

            </p>      
            
            <br>
            
            <h4>Your Paper at the Conference</h4>
            <p>
             Authors are required to present their work in a scheduled session with other 
                ICS’22 Papers. Papers whose authors are not at the conference to present 
                their paper may be removed from the ACM Digital Library. 

            </p> 
            <br>
            
             <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
            <p>
             Elements in this document regarding concurrent submissions, anonymity, and ethical 
                obligations are taken from previous SIGARCH conferences, particularly the last 
                two instances of the ASPLOS conference (ASPLOS’20, ASPLOS’21), the program chairs 
                of which we wish to thank.
