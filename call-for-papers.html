            <h3>Call for papers</h3>
            <p>The ACM International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS) is the premier international forum for the presentation 
                of research results in high-performance computing systems. The 36th conference (ICS-2022) will be held as a virtual 
                global event in June 2022. Papers are solicited on all aspects of the architecture, software, and applications of 
                high-performance computing systems of all scales (from chips to supercomputing systems), including but not limited to:
       
                </p>
            
             <ul>
  <li>Processor, memory, storage, accelerator and interconnect architectures , including architectures based on future and emerging hardware (e.g. quantum, photonic, neuromorphic).
</li>
  <li>Programming languages, paradigms and execution models, including domain-specific languages and scientific problem-solving software environments.
</li>
  <li>Compilers, runtime systems and system software, including optimization and support for hardware resource management, energy management, fault tolerance, correctness, reproducibility, and security.
</li>
                 
 <li>High-performance algorithms and applications including machine learning and large-scale data analytics, as well as the implementation and deployment of algorithms and applications on large-scale systems.
</li>
  <li>Tools for measurement, modeling, analysis and visualization of performance, energy, or other quantitative properties of high performance computing systems, including data and code visualization tools.
  </li>          
</ul> 
            
The review process will include a rebuttal period, and the papers will be evaluated based on novelty, technical soundness, and potential impact on the field. <br><br>
